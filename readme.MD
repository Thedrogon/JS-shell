# Mini JS Shell

This is a tiny shell written in JavaScript, built by following the Codecrafters guide. It reads user input, prints basic responses, and lays the groundwork for a more complete shell. The goal is to understand how real shells handle input, parsing, and command execution step by step.

## Features
- Interactive prompt (`$`)
- Reads user input line by line
- Basic error message for unknown commands
- Simple structure that can grow with real command handling later

## How to Run
```bash
node main.js
